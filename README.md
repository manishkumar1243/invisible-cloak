# invisible-cloak
 Invisible Cloak Project – OpenCV &amp; Python  This project is a real-time Invisibility Cloak effect created using OpenCV and NumPy. It detects a specific color in the video frame (Yellow in this version) and replaces that region with the previously captured background — generating the illusion of invisibility.
